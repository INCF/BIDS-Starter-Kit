## Joining the community

BIDS - the [Brain Imaging Data Structure][bids] - is a growing community of
neuroimaging enthusiasts, and we want to make our resources accessible to and
engaging for as many researchers as possible.

We therefore require that all contributions **adhere to our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

How do you know that you're a member of the BIDS community? You're here! You
know that BIDS exists! You're officially a member of the community. It's THAT
easy! Welcome! :joy::raised_hands:

## Get in touch

We have lots of different ways of staying in touch!

**Our preferred way to answer questions** is via our forum
[Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/tags/bids) (we have a 90%+ answer rate!)

We understand that posting a question on a forum can seem a bit uncertain and
intimidating. However, if _you_ have a question it's almost certain that
somebody else will too, and this way we can avoid answering the same question
multiple times. Even if your question is not well-defined, just post what you
have so far and we will be able to point you in the right direction!

Some example questions that have already been answered include:

-   [BIDS file naming specifications](https://neurostars.org/t/bids-beginner-convert-data-to-bids-format/1364)
-   [BIDS beginner - convert data to BIDS format](https://neurostars.org/t/bids-beginner-convert-data-to-bids-format/1364)

You can also come chat on the
[Brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/):

-   on the
    [`~bids_general`](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bids_general)
    channel
-   or on the
    [`~starter-kit`](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/bids-starter-kit)

We'd love for you to join the mailing list (bids-discussion@googlegroups.com,
click [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bids-discussion) to join).
You might find some helpful answers and discussions there.

## Contributing through GitHub

[git][git] is a really useful tool for version control. [GitHub][github] sits on
top of git and supports collaborative and distributed working.

We know that it can be daunting to start using git and GitHub if you haven't
worked with them in the past, but the BIDS Starter Kit maintainers are here to
help you figure out any of the jargon or confusing instructions you encounter!
:heart:

In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign
in. Here are some
[instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
to help you get going. Remember that you can ask us any questions you need to
along the way.

## Writing in markdown

GitHub has a helpful page on
[getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown][markdown]. You can
think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow
GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting. For example you could
write words as bold (`**bold**`), or in italics (`*italics*`), or as a
[link][rick-roll] (`[link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another
webpage.

## Where to start: wiki, code and templates

### Wiki ([link][bids-starterkit-book])

We hope that the easiest place to find information about BIDS is the [**starter
kit wiki**][bids-starterkit-book].

You only need to be logged in to GitHub to edit the wiki. So, there's no need
for a pull request if you just want to fix a typo or add a useful link!

Here's a useful [introduction to GitHub wikis][intro-github-wiki]. Have a read
through the pages that already exist in the wiki and please EDIT AWAY!
:muscle::boom::sparkles:

### Code ([link][bids-starterkit-repo])

This repository is under development, but we hope that it becomes a useful place
for people to share and find small snippets of code that are useful for getting
started with BIDS.

To contribute to the codebase you'll need to submit a pull request. Check out
our [guidelines](#making-a-change-with-a-pull-request) below.

In general if you are contributing some code that requires some inputs, either
provide that input or a link on how to access it, and an example on how to run
that code.

#### Matlab / Octave

We are using the Miss_hit linter to help us keep out matlab "clean". You can
find more information on how to set it up and use it on the bids-matlab
[contributing guidelines](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-matlab/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#matlab-code-style-guide-and-quality).

### Templates ([link][bids-starterkit-repo])

This repository is under development, but we aim to have two templates for each
BIDS sidecar file:

-   one with a `full` example (all required/recommended/optional fields),
-   one with a `short` example (only required fields).

If possible try to provide a script (python, octave, matlab) to generate those
templates.

Try to name your script as follow: `createBIDS_<suffix>_<extension>_*.[py|m]`

```
createBIDS_T1w_json_short.m
```

To contribute a template you'll need to submit a pull request. Check out our
[guidelines](#making-a-change-with-a-pull-request) below.

## Where to start: issue labels

The list of labels for current issues can be found
[here][bids-starterkit-labels] and includes:

-   [![help-wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg)][labels-helpwanted]
    _These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we
    need additional help with._

    If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we especially
    encourage you to do so!

-   [![Question](https://img.shields.io/badge/-question-cc317c.svg)][labels-question]
    _These issues contain a question that you'd like to have answered._

    There are [lots of ways to ask questions](#get-in-touch) but opening an
    issue is a great way to start a conversation and get your answer. Ideally,
    we'll close it out by **_[adding the answer to the
    wiki][bids-starterkit-book]!_**

-   [![good-first-issue](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-1b3487.svg)][labels-firstissue]
    _These issues are particularly appropriate if it is your first contribution
    to the BIDS Starter Kit, or to GitHub overall._

    If you're not sure about how to go about contributing, these are good places
    to start. You'll be mentored through the process by the maintainers team. If
    you're a seasoned contributor, please select a different issue to work from
    and keep these available for the newer and potentially more anxious team
    members.

-   [![Enhancement](https://img.shields.io/badge/-enhancement-84b6eb.svg)][labels-enhancement]
    _These issues are suggesting new features that can be added to the project._

    If you want to ask for something new, please try to make sure that your
    request is distinct from any others that are already in the queue (or part
    of the starter kit!). If you find one that's similar but there are subtle
    differences please reference the other enhancement in your issue.

-   [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/-documentation-ffd700.svg)][labels-documentation]
    _These issues relate to improving or updating the documentation._

    These are usually really great issues to help out with: our goal is to make
    it easy to understand BIDS without having to ask anyone any questions!
    Documentation is the ultimate solution :trophy:

-   [![Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/-community-8605c1.svg)][labels-community]
    _These issues relate to building and supporting the BIDS community._

    BIDS won't work if people don't use the standard! YOU are the BIDS
    community, and we want to know how best to support you.

-   [![Bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bug-ee0701.svg)][labels-bug] _These
    issues are reporting a problem or a mistake in the project._

    The more details you can provide the better! If you know how to fix the bug,
    please open an issue first and then
    [submit a pull request](#making-a-change-with-a-pull-request) :sparkles:

-   [![Closing Soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/-closing%20soon-ed6186.svg)][labels-closingsoon]
    _These issues are closing soon...get your opinions in asap!_

    This label is mostly used to indicate that an old issue is about to be
    closed, or that a final decision is going to be made on a long running
    discussion. Speak now....or open a new issue when this one is gone
    :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

-   [![Funding](https://img.shields.io/badge/-funding-55e0c2.svg)][labels-funding]
    _These issues relate to finding money money money to keep building the
    project_

    We'd love to hear about any opportunities for funding to keep building the
    BIDS Starter Kit :moneybag:

-   [![Logistics](https://img.shields.io/badge/-logistics-deaefc.svg)][labels-logistics]
    _These issues relate to project management for the BIDS starter kit_

    We like to model best practice, so the BIDS Starter Kit itself is managed
    through these issues. We may occasionally have some to coordinate some
    logistics.

## Making a change with a pull request

We appreciate all contributions to the BIDS Starter Kit. **THANK YOU** for
helping us build this useful resource. :sparkles::star2::dizzy:

:point\*right: Remember that if you're adding information to the [wiki](#wiki)
you \*\*\_don't need to submit a pull request**\*. You can just log into GitHub,
navigate to the [wiki][bids-starterkit-book] and click the**edit\*\* button.

If you're updating the [code](#code) or the [templates](#templates), the
following steps are a guide to help you contribute in a way that will be easy
for everyone to review and accept with ease :sunglasses:.

#### 1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition

This allows other members of the BIDS Starter Kit team to confirm that you
aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on
the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog][dont-push-pull-request] is a nice explanation of why putting this
work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

#### 2. [Fork][github-fork] the [BIDS Starter Kit repository][bids-starterkit-repo] to your profile

This is now your own unique copy of the BIDS Starter Kit. Changes here won't
affect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][github-syncfork] with the master
repository, otherwise you can end up with lots of dreaded [merge
conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].

#### 3. Make the changes you've discussed

Try to keep the changes focused. If you submit a large amount of work in all in
one go it will be much more work for whomever is reviewing your pull request.
[Help them help you][jerry-maguire] :wink:

If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new
branch][github-branches] and a [new issue][bids-starterkit-issues] to go with
it.

#### 4. Submit a [pull request][github-pullrequest]

A member of the BIDS Starter Kit team will review your changes to confirm that
they can be merged into the main codebase.

A [review][github-review] will probably consist of a few questions to help
clarify the work you've done. Keep an eye on your github notifications and be
prepared to join in that conversation.

You can update your [fork][github-fork] of the BIDS Starter Kit
[repository][bids-starterkit-repo] and the pull request will automatically
update with those changes. You don't need to submit a new pull request when you
make a change in response to a review.

GitHub has a [nice introduction][github-flow] to the pull request workflow, but
please [get in touch](#get-in-touch) if you have any questions :balloon:.
