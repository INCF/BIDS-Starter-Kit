# Frequently Asked Questions

As this starter-kit grows it gets harder to know where to find information,
so this page is a collection of frequently asked questions.

Please add to this list!

It will always be ðŸš§ **in construction** ðŸš§
and we really encourage everyone to update it to be more useful.
If there's a question you've asked or answered more than twice
then it's an FAQ and it should be in the repository.

Ideally the questions will link to an answer elsewhere in the repository
to maximise the different ways of finding out more about BIDS.

```{note}
For questions related to the BIDS apps,
please visit [the BIDS apps website](https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/dev_faq/).

## General: How do I convert my data to BIDS?

We strongly recommend you pick a BIDS converter to help you convert your data.

A list of converters can be found [on the BIDS website](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/benefits.html#converters)

Also look at [the list of tutorials and information about conversions](./tutorials/tutorials.md).

## General: How to import Excel files to TSV file?

See [our sections on TSV files](./folders_and_files/metadata.md#tsv-files) for more information.

See also this bids tool to import and export a `participants.tsv` file:
[bids-matlab-tools](https://github.com/sccn/bids-matlab-tools/blob/master/bids_spreadsheet2participants.m)

## General: How to specify the micro sign in MATLAB?

The symbol used to indicate `Âµ` has unicode U+00B5, which is in MATLAB:

```matlab
char(181)
```

## General: I had to split the testing of one of my participants across 2 days, should I use 2 different session folders to organize the data of that participant?

(faq_session)=

No. The `session` level in the BIDS folder hierarchy can be used to group data
that go "logically" together: this means that you can put in the same `session` folder
data that were acquired on different days,
but that are "linked" to one another in a way that make sense to how you want to organize your data.

If you want to keep track of what data was acquired when you can use the
[`scans.tsv` files](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03-modality-agnostic-files.html#scans-file).

For some examples, see this
[issue in the bids-starter kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/issues/193).

If you deal with EEG data, you may want to read this
[comment in another issue](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/issues/265#issuecomment-1082240834)
as well before considering combining recordings acquired on different occasions
within the same `session` folder.

## General: Is your data type not covered in the current BIDS specification?

BIDS extensions proposals [(BEPs)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification)
aim to extend the BIDS specification to new data types.
A list of extensions proposals can be found [on the main BIDS webpage](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
under [Get Involved](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification).
Guidelines for contributing to these extensions or starting your own can be found
in the [BIDS Extension Proposals Guide](https://bids-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

If only part of your data is covered under BIDS, an option to allow additional files
currently not covered in BIDS to pass the validator is
the [.bidsignore](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator/blob/master/bids-validator/README.md) file,
which works just like [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
It allows you to list all the files (or directories, with wildcards) that are not
BIDS compliant and should be ignored by the validator. Of course you should
still try to adhere to upcoming BEPs and the general BIDS philosophy for file
names and metadata where possible, but this gives a little extra flexibility.

## General: What does [this word] mean?

We're building a glossary to de-jargonise some of the terms you need to know to
work with data in BIDS format. Check it out [here](./glossary.md).

## General: What is a `json` file?

You can find more information about `json` (and `tsv`) files in the
[Metadata-file-formats](./folders_and_files/metadata.md#json) page.
