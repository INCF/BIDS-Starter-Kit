      <p>
        The README is usually the starting point for researchers using your data
        and serves as a guidepost for users of your data. A clear and informative
        README makes your data much more usable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general you can include information in the README that is not captured
        by some other files in the BIDS dataset
        (<code>dataset_description.json</code>, <code>events.tsv</code>, ...).
      </p>
      <p>
        It can also be useful to also include information that might already be
        present in another file of the dataset but might be important for users to be aware of
        before preprocessing or analysing the data.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the README gets too long you have the possibility to create a <code>/doc</code> folder
        and add it to the <code>.bidsignore</code> file to make sure it is ignored by the BIDS validator.

          An easy thing to add is the output of the bids-validator

          one can expect to find in the dataset.

        <input class="textField" type="text" id="taskOverview" name="taskOverview" value="2020-2021">
        <p>
          A paragraph giving an overview of the experiment.
          This should include the goals or purpose and a discussion
          about how the experiment tries to achieve these goals.
        </p>

-   [ ] Independent variables

A brief discussion of condition variables (sometimes called contrasts or
independent variables) that were varied across the experiment.

-   [ ] Dependent variables

A brief discussion of the response variables (sometimes called the dependent
variables) that were measured and or calculated to assess the effects of varying
the condition variables. This might also include questionnaires administered to
assess behavioral aspects of the experiment.

-   [ ] Control variables

A brief discussion of the control variables --- that is what aspects were
explicitly controlled in this experiment. The control variables might include
subject pool, environmental conditions, set up, or other things that were
explicitly controlled.

-   [ ] Quality assessment of the data

Provide a short summary of the quality of the data ideally with descriptive
statistics if relevant and with a link to more comprehensive description (like
with MRIQC) if possible.

      <h2>Methods</h2>

      <h3>Subjects</h3>

      A brief sentence about the subject pool in this experiment.

Remember that `Control` or `Patient` status should be defined in the
`participants.tsv` using a group column.

-   [ ] Information about the recruitment procedure
-   [ ] Subject inclusion criteria (if relevant)
-   [ ] Subject exclusion criteria (if relevant)

          <h3>Apparatus</h3>

          <p>
            A summary of the equipment and environment setup for the experiment. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For example:
            <ul>
              <li>
                the experiment was performed in a shielded room with the subject seated in a fixed position.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>Initial setup</h3>

          <p>A summary of what setup was performed when a subject arrived.</p>

          <h3>Task organization</h3>

How the tasks were organized for a session. This is particularly important
because BIDS datasets usually have task data separated into different files.)

-   [ ] Was task order counter-balanced?
-   [ ] What other activities were interspersed between tasks?

-   [ ] In what order were the tasks and other activities performed?

          <h3>Task details</h3>

          <p>As much detail as possible about the task and the events that were recorded.</p>

          <h3>Additional data acquired</h3>

          A brief indication of data other than the

    imaging data that was acquired as part of this experiment. In addition to
    data from other modalities and behavioral data, this might include
    questionnaires and surveys, swabs, and clinical information. Indicate the
    availability of this data.

This is especially relevant if the data are not included in a `phenotype`
folder.
https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/03-modality-agnostic-files.html#phenotypic-and-assessment-data

      <h3>Experimental location</h3>

      <p>
        This should include any additional information regarding the geographical location and facility 
        that cannot be included in the relevant json files.
      </p>

      <h2>Missing data</h2>

      <p>
        Mention something if some participants are missing some aspects of the data.
        This can take the form of a processing log and/or abnormalities about the dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A brain lesion or defect only present in one participant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some experimental conditions missing on a given run for a participant
            because of some technical issue.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <input class="textField" type="text" id="missingData" name="missingData" value="">

      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <label for="notes">
        Any additional information or pointers to information
        that might be helpful to users of the dataset.
        Include qualitative information related to how the data acquisition went.
      </label>
      <p>
        Some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            One participant was not scanned with the same resolution as the others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any noticeable feature of the data for certain participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Differences (even slight) in protocol for certain participants.
          </li>
        </ul>
